Ie built SafeReport because I saw how many safety incidents in our communities are either ignored, not reported at all, or forgotten. A big reason is that people don’t always feel safe sharing their identity, and even if they do, there’s little trust that the information will be kept secure. SafeReport makes it easy for anyone to report issues while keeping their identity protected.

In South Africa, the police service is often not reliable. Too many times, cases are not followed up, evidence is tampered with, or files are lost. This leaves victims without justice and communities without trust. With SafeReport, reports are stored on the **blockchain**, meaning they cannot be changed or deleted. This makes the information reliable and transparent, no matter who tries to interfere.

The app will not only give access to the police but also to human rights groups, women empowerment organisations, and other trusted partners, so that there are multiple watchdogs making sure cases are not ignored.

One of the key features is the Red Zone. With this, you can set your current location, where you’re going, and how long it should take you. If you don’t check in safely, the app can trigger alerts. This is especially helpful for people moving through high-risk areas.

As we grow the app, we plan to add more security updates and features. For example, real-time alerts from others nearby, safe route suggestions, and the ability to share updates with local authorities or community leaders. We want SafeReport to become a full safety hub that not only records incidents but also helps prevent them and keeps people connected when they need it most.
